Please keep the following things in mind when committing:
1. Be sure the source code is properly formatted.
A general rule for proper formatting is just to press `CTRL-SHIFT-F` (Eclipse keybind),
and make sure most of the text that belongs on one line stays there.
2. _DO NOT_ delete things and leave it at that;
please provide proper reasoning for why said things were deleted.
